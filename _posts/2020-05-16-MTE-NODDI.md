## MTE-NODDI disentangles non-T2-weighted signal fractions from T2 relaxation


## Robust estimates with reduced number of TE's 

## Non-T2-weighted fractions may improve the interpretability of neurodevelopmental studies

For future applications, the MTE-NODDI could be beneficial to the understanding and interpretability of neuroimaging studies, especially for those investigating age-related brain alterations, in which substantial alterations of T2-weighted intra-neurite fraction and T2 relaxation time have been reported throughout the lifespan. For example, the T2-weighted intra-neurite fractions have been shown to increase during brain development (Kansagra et al., 2016) and maturation (Geeraert et al., 2019; Mah et al., 2017), followed with a plateau at adulthood (Kodiweera et al., 2016) and to decrease during aging (Cox et al., 2016; Merluzzi et al., 2016). In contrast, the T2 values in WM have been shown to decrease quickly during early development and decrease slower during maturation (Ding et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2018), followed by increasing in most brain regions and declining in a few regions during aging (Kumar et al., 2012). However, the intrinsic microstructural changes behind the development process remain unclear due to the limitations of conventional single TE method. With the ability to disentangle the T2-weighted signal fraction from T2 weighting, the MTE-NODDI developed in this study can be applied.
